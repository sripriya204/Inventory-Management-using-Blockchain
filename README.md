# Inventory-Management-using-Blockchain

This Go code combines user authentication and blockchain-based inventory management into a comprehensive system. The user authentication system enables user registration and login using bcrypt hashing to securely store and compare passwords. User credentials are stored in a JSON file for persistence.

The inventory management system allows users to add, remove, and view items in their inventory. Each action generates a transaction record that is logged and stored in a JSON file for future reference. The system also offers real-time updates on inventory changes.

The blockchain functionality is responsible for creating, verifying, and auditing blocks that contain inventory updates and transactions. A new block is generated when an inventory action occurs, linking it to the previous block to maintain data integrity.

The program also supports loading and saving the blockchain state from a JSON file, ensuring persistence and continuity across sessions. Users can view their transaction history and the blockchain state to verify their actions and maintain trust in the system.

The program also has real-time updates for the inventory.
